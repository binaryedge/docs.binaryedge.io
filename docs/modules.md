## General Data Format

All events generated by our scanning platform, delivered via our Data Streams or API Queries, have the following outline:

Details of the fields:

* **origin**:
    * **client_id**:
        * Your client ID. Optional, appears only on the client stream.
    * **job_id**:
        * Job ID that event is part of. Optional, appears only on the client stream.
    * **type**:
        * Event type, module that produced the event;
        * Please refer to the next section for details on each module type.
    * **module**:
        * Either 'portscan' or 'grabber'. Category of the event. Portscan events merely indicate that a port was found open. Grabber events will contain more extracted data such as details of the ip/port/service;
    * **ip**:
        * IP used by the scanner to perform the analysis;
    * **port**:
        * Port used by the scanner to perform the analysis. Optional, only some modules will provide this information.
    * **ts**:
        * Unix Timestamp in Milliseconds;
    * **country**:
        * ISO code of the country the scanner that originated this event is located in;
* **target**:
    * **ip**:
        * Target Address used for connection;
    * **port**:
        * Target Port used for connection;
    * **protocol**:
        * Target Protocol used for connection;
* **result**:
    * **data**:
        * Varies according to each different module;
        * Please refer to the next section for details on each module type.

## Modules

Below are all the modules available for scanning on the platform. All modules support _hostnames_, _IPv4 addresses_ and _IPv6 addresses_. These modules are the same modules that feed our Host database.

### Service Identification

#### service-simple

The Service-Simple module attempts to connect to a remote server and identify service / product information by sending various payloads and analysing how the server responds. This module is much faster than the _service_ module, since it doesn't perform any more actions than this. For more details, use the _service_ module.

See [More Info](modules/service-simple.md "service-simple")

#### service

The Service module attempts to connect to a remote server and identify service / product information by sending various payloads and analysing how the server responds as well as extract other available service information such as headers or hostnames if available. For simple service identification, consider using the faster _service-simple_ module.

See [More Info](modules/service.md "service")

#### malware-simple

The Malware-Simple module attempts to connect to a remote server and identify malware by sending various payloads and analysing how the server responds. It works similarly to the _service-simple_ module except it is entirely focused at identifying malware instead of general service/product information.

See [More Info](modules/malware-simple.md "malware-simple")

### Remote Desktop

#### rdp

The RDP module attempts to connect to a RDP server and take a screenshot of the display as well as extract the security level used, if any.

See [More Info](modules/rdp.md "rdp")

#### vnc

The VNC module attempts to connect to a VNC server and take a screenshot of the display as well as extract relevant information.

See [More Info](modules/vnc.md "vnc")

#### x11

The X11 module attempts to connect to a X11 server and take a screenshot of the display as well as extract relevant information.

See [More Info](modules/x11.md "x11")

#### bluekeep

The Bluekeep module attempts to determine if an RDP server is vulnerable to the Bluekeep vulnerability.

See [More Info](modules/bluekeep.md "bluekeep")

### Databases

#### cassandra

The Cassandra module attempts to connect to a Cassandra server via client driver connection and extract cluster metadata as well as a list of keyspaces and respective tables.

See [More Info](modules/cassandra.md "cassandra")

#### elasticsearch

The Elasticsearch module attempts to connect to an Elasticsearch server via REST API and extract cluster metadata and stats as well as a list of indices.

See [More Info](modules/elasticsearch.md "elasticsearch")

#### memcached

The Memcached module attempts to connect to a Memcached server via client driver connection and extract server stats.

See [More Info](modules/memcached.md "memcached")

#### mongodb

The MongoDB module attempts to connect to a MongoDB server via client driver connection and extract server metadata as well as a list of databases and respective collections.

See [More Info](modules/mongodb.md "mongodb")

#### redis

The Redis module attempts to connect to a Redis server via client driver connection and extract server metadata.

See [More Info](modules/redis.md "redis")

### Message Queues

#### mqtt

The MQTT module attempts to connect to a MQTT server and extract a few seconds of passing messages to determine active topics.

See [More Info](modules/mqtt.md "mqtt")

### HTTP / Web

#### webv2

The Webv2 module attempts to connect to an HTTP server and extract HTTP headers, redirects, page title, favicon, HTML source code, the web technologies being used and take a screenshot of the web page. It combines and upgrades upon the functionality of _http_, _https_ and _web_.

See [More Info](modules/webv2.md "webv2")

#### web-enrich

The web-enrich module attempts to connect to an HTTP server and extract HTTP headers, redirects, HTML source code, the web technologies and enrich data that the module webv2 couldn't find or doesn't look for.

See [More Info](modules/web-enrich.md "web-enrich")

#### http / https

*DEPRECATED - Please refer to the [webv2](modules/webv2.md "webv2") module*

The HTTP/HTTPS modules attempt to connect to an HTTP server and extract HTTP headers, redirects, page title and HTML source code.

See [More Info](modules/http.md "http")

### Protocols

#### ssl-simple

The SSL-Simple module attempts to connect to an SSL-wrapped server and extract (and parse) certificate chains. Recommended if you are only interested in certificates, since it is much faster than the _sslv2_ module as it doesn't need to do any additional testing.

See [More Info](modules/ssl-simple.md "ssl-simple")

#### sslv2

The SSLv2 module attempts to connect to an SSL-wrapped server and extract (and parse) certificate chains, ciphers and vulnerabilities. It is an upgraded version of the _ssl_ module, and includes extra updates and features not available previously.

See [More Info](modules/sslv2.md "sslv2")

#### jarm

The JARM module attempts to actively fingerprint an SSL/TLS server via a series of TLS Client Hello packets to extract specific responses that can be used to quickly identify default applications or malware.

See [More Info](modules/jarm.md "jarm")

### Services

#### ssh

The SSH module attempts to connect to a SSH server and extract all the algorithms supported by the server.

See [More Info](modules/ssh.md "ssh")

#### rsync

The RSYNC module attempts to connect to an RSYNC server anonymously and list the available modules (list the contents at the root directory).

See [More Info](modules/rsync.md "rsync")

#### ftp

The FTP module attempts to connect to an FTP server anonymously and recursively list available directories.

See [More Info](modules/ftp.md "ftp")

#### telnet

The Telnet module attempts to connect to a server by opening a connection and extracting the initial payload, if any.

See [More Info](modules/telnet.md "telnet")

#### smb

The SMB module attempts to connect to a server with SMB by opening a connection and extracting dialects and shares, if any.

See [More Info](modules/smb.md "smb")

### Containers

#### kubernetes

The Kubernetes module attempts to connect to a Kubernetes server via REST API and extract a list of pods and their respective metadata.

See [More Info](modules/kubernetes.md "kubernetes")
