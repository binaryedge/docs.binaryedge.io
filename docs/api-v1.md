## Data Stream

Continuous Data Stream of events generated by our platform.

```
Important: The Stream might disconnect sometimes, as such, it is the client's responsibility to reconnect, as it might miss results while disconnected. However, no data is really lost, since there is always the possibility of replay.
```

There are 2 types of Data Streams available that can be consumed, based on your client account permissions.

#### 1. Firehose

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/firehose

_Description_: This stream contains all data generated by Binaryedge own scans. These include the continuous WorldWide Scans that target different ports every day. This stream does not contain data generated from jobs requested by clients.

#### 2. Stream

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream

_Description_: This stream contains all data generated by your own requested Jobs. Clients don't have access to data generated from scans of other clients.

#### 3. Torrent

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/torrent

_Description_: This stream contains data generated by our listeners on the DHT, which is a series of events referring to "who is downloading what from whom".

See [Torrent Data](torrent.md) for details.

#### 4. Sinkhole

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/sinkhole

_Description_: This stream contains data generated by our "listen-only" machines, i.e., what everyone else has been scanning on our machines.

See [Sensor Data](sensors.md) for details.

```

### GET /v1/replay/job_id - Replay Job

```shell
curl 'https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/replay/<JOB_ID>' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<Stream results from request job>
```

### Job Status

In order for you to know the status of your jobs we provide information in 2 distinct ways:

#### 1. GET /v1/tasks/job_id/status - Status Endpoint

To check the current status of a Requested job:

```shell
curl 'https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/tasks/<JOB_ID>/status' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"status":"<STATUS>"}
```

Where Status can be:

* "requested": Job was requested successfully;
* "revoked": Job was revoked by user;
* "success": Job completed successfully;
* "failed": Job completed, but did not finish.

#### 2. Status Messages inside stream

In your stream you will find messages providing insight on the current status of your jobs:

**Job Created**

```json
{
  "origin": {
    "job_id": "c4773cb-aa1e-4356eac1ad08",
    "type": "job_status"
  },
  "status": {
    "success": null,
    "started": null,
    "completed": null,
    "revoked": null
  }
}
```

**Job Completed**

```json
{
  "origin": {
    "job_id": "c4773cb-aa1e-4356eac1ad08",
    "type": "job_status"
  },
  "status": {
    "success": true,
    "started": true,
    "completed": true,
    "revoked": false
  }
}
```

Meaning of the status fields:

  * "success": If the job was completed successfully, with no problems;
  * "started": When a job is requested, it is put into a queue;
  * "completed": If the job is completed, no more results will be sent;
  * "revoked": If the job was canceled by the user or not.


### Supported Job Types

There are 2 types of requests.

### 1. scan
The scan type will request a portscan on the targets and will launch the modules against the detected open ports only. It can be used against any number of targets. 

It's highly recommended to use if there is a large number of targets, this way it filters responding IPs before launching modules, which can speed up a job greatly.

Scanning supports both IP addresses and domains, but since portscan will resolve domains and use their IP addresses, some domains' results might only obtainable if you use the _grab_ type directly on them.

### 2. grab
The grab type will try to gather information directly from the targets, without portscanning first. Should only be used against a small number of targets, since it will launch the modules against all targets without and filtering first.

Recommended mostly for when targeting domains, for instance with HTTP/HTTPS, Web or SSL modules. 

## Supported Modules Types

See [List of Modules](modules.md) for a list of all available modules and their descriptions.

### Custom Modules
Note: If you want a custom-made module, please contact BinaryEdge.

## Configurations
It is possible to set module specific configurations on the job requests. For example, the HTTP module allows the configuration of the Host and the User Agent HTTP headers.
The configuration should be set in the "config" key at the same JSON level of the requested modules.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "scan",
  "description": "test a bunch of networks",
  "options": [
    {
      "targets": ["xxx.xxx.x.x/xx","xxx.xxx.x.x/xx"],
      "ports": [{
        "port": 80,
        "modules": ["http"],
        "config":
          {
            "user_agent":"Test user Agent",
            "host_header":"google.com"
          }
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available configurations

Check each module's detailed documentation for the available configurations. See [List of Modules](modules.md).

#### /v1/query/sensors/search/stats

Statistics of events for the given query. Can be used with specific parameters and/or full-text search.

*Parameters*

* query: [String] String used to query our data. If no filters are used, it will perform a full-text search on the entire events. See [Search Parameters](sensors-search.md) for details on what parameters can be used.
* type: [String] Type of statistic we want to obtain. Possible types include:
    * _ports_, _tags_, _countries_, _asn_, _ips_, _payloads_, _http\_path_, _rdns_.
* days: [Integer] Optional. Number of days to get the stats for. For example, days=1 for the last day of data.
    * Default: _days=30_
* order: [String] Optional. Whether to sort descendently or ascendently to get the top.
    * _desc_, _asc_
    * Default: _order=desc_

*Output*

```shell
curl 'https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/query/sensors/search/stats?query=tags:ssh_scanner&type=ports' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN'
```

```

#### /v1/query/sensors/tag/<tag>

Get a list of IPs that have been associated with a specific TAG. See [List of Tags](sensors-tags.md)

*Parameters*

* tag: [String] Tag you want to get the list of IPs related to.
    * Example: _tag=MALICIOUS_
* days: [Integer] Query Parameter, number of days to get the stats for. For example, days=1 for the last day of data.
    * Default: _days=1_
    * Max: _days=60_

*Output*

```shell
curl 'https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/query/sensors/tag/MALICIOUS' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN'
```

```json
["1.34.221.87", "1.160.38.189", "1.160.39.129", "1.160.91.241", "1.160.130.56", "1.160.160.98", "1.161.118.167"]
```


### FAQ

**Q: What is the sample parameter?**

**A:** The Sample parameter is used to define how many open ports the platform needs to find before stopping the scan. It is useful to test modules and different configurations for each module (that we are adding in the future). This parameter is optional - by default the scan stops only after scanning the entire list of IP addresses and ports.


**Q: How can I consume the stream?**

**A:** The stream outputs to STDOUT, allowing you to consume it in different ways. For example:

- Direct the stream to a file:
    - `curl 'https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN' > file.txt`
- Pipe the stream to a custom application you developed to process it:
    - `curl 'https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream' -H 'X-Token:API_TOKEN' | application_name `


**Q: What should I do if I get a error 500?**

**A:** In this case, you should contact support@binaryedge.io


**Q: How do I scan multiple hosts with one request?**

**A:**

```json
options: [{
  "targets": ["array of cidrs (string)"],
  "ports": [{
    "port": "int",
    "modules": ["array of module names (string)"],
    "sample": "int"
  }]
}]
```

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "scan",
  "description": "test a bunch of networks",
  "options": [
    {
      "targets": ["xxx.xxx.x.x/xx","xxx.xxx.x.x/xx"],
      "ports": [{
        "port": 995,
        "modules": ["service"]
      },
      {
        "port": 22,
        "modules": ["ssh"]
      }]
    }, {
      "targets": ["xxx.xxx.x.x/xx"],
      "ports": [{
        "port": 5900,
        "modules": ["vnc"]
      }]
    }
  ]
}
```
